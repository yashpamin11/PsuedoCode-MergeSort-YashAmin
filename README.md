Hi I'm Yash Amin and this is my code for the bonus question for HW5 in CSE foundations. My name and buckid number are included in the top of the code for my mergesort. I've included pdfs of my code, test code,
a compressed zip file with the code and a pdf of the output of the test cases which end up all working. I've also included a picture of my psuedocode.
